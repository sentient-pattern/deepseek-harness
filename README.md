# ForgeWeaver

English | [中文](README.zh.md)

ForgeWeaver (`fw`) is an open-source agent harness developed by [ForgeWeaver AI](https://forgeweaver.com).

It uses an architecture where **everything is a plugin**, and is powered by [Cordis](https://github.com/cordiverse/cordis), whose design is described in [_A Programming Paradigm for Spatiotemporal Composability_](https://github.com/cordiverse/paper).

## Developer preview

ForgeWeaver is currently in _developer preview_ and is iterating rapidly. **THERE WILL BE COMPATIBILITY-BREAKING CHANGES.**

## Run

### Run from `npm`

Install `Node.js`, then run:

```sh
npx @forgeweaver/fw web
```

The command starts the Web UI at `http://127.0.0.1:3080` by default and opens it in the default browser for a local launch. An SSH launch only prints the host URL because the SSH client or editor owns the local forwarded address. Pass `--no-open` to run the server without opening a browser. See [Web UI guide](docs/user/guide/index.md).

### Run from source

To run from a repository checkout:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/sentient-pattern/deepseek-harness.git
cd forgeweaver-harness
pnpm install
pnpm run build
pnpm fw web
```

`pnpm run build` prepares the repository artifacts. `pnpm fw web` uses those built artifacts without rebuilding.
